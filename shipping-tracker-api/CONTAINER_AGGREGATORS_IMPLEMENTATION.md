3. **Reliability First**: Prioritizes high-reliability providers regardless of cost

**Provider Scoring System**:
- Base reliability score (0-100 points)

- User tier adjustments (up to 100 points for free users)
- Failure penalties (up to 30 points deduction)
- BOL compatibility filtering

**Test Coverage**: 34 comprehensive tests covering all routing scenarios

## Integration with APIAggregator

### Enhanced fetchFromMultipleSources Method

The APIAggregator now uses smart routing to:

1. **Analyze Context**: Container format, user tier, cost preferences
2. **Detect Carrier**: Pattern matching with confidence scoring
3. **Prioritize Providers**: Intelligent scoring based on multiple factors
4. **Execute Strategy**: Try providers in optimal order
5. **Learn from Results**: Record successes/failures for future routing

### Smart Routing Decision Process

```typescript
const routingContext = {
  trackingNumber: 'MAEU1234567',
  trackingType: 'container',
  userTier: 'free',
  costOptimization: true
};

const decision = smartRouter.analyzeRouting(routingContext);
// Result: Prioritizes Maersk (carrier match) but considers cost for free user
```

### Failure Recovery System

- **Failure Recording**: Tracks API failures with timestamps
- **Penalty System**: Reduces provider scores based on recent failures
- **Recovery Mechanism**: Gradually restores provider reputation on success
- **Intelligent Fallback**: Avoids recently failed providers

## Performance Characteristics

### Response Times (Typical)
- **ShipsGo**: 300-1500ms (aggregated data)
- **SeaRates**: 400-1800ms (with cost analysis)
- **Smart Router**: <10ms (pattern detection and scoring)

### Reliability Scores
- **ShipsGo**: 88% (Good aggregator reliability)
- **SeaRates**: 85% (Good with cost features)
- **Smart Router**: 99% (Local processing, very reliable)

### Rate Limits
- **ShipsGo**: 100/min, 2000/hour (freemium)
- **SeaRates**: 60/min, 1000/hour (freemium)
- **Smart Router**: No limits (local processing)

### Cost Optimization
