### Tier 4: Free Container Tracking (1 Provider)
**Coverage**: Free backup tracking service
- **Track-Trace** (Reliability: 68%) - Free container tracking service

## ðŸŽ¯ Strategic Advantages

### 1. **Maximum Success Rate**
- **Primary Strategy**: Try high-reliability carriers first (Maersk, FedEx, UPS)
- **Fallback Strategy**: Use aggregators (Project44, FourKites) for comprehensive coverage
- **Last Resort**: Free services and regional specialists

### 2. **Cost Optimization**
```
Free Tier: USPS, Canada Post, Track-Trace (0 cost)
Freemium: ShipsGo, SeaRates, Marine Traffic (low cost, limited requests)
Paid Tier: Major carriers (medium cost, high reliability)
Premium Tier: Project44, FourKites (high cost, maximum coverage)
```

### 3. **Geographic Coverage**
- **Global**: Major carriers + aggregators (80% coverage)
- **Asia-Pacific**: COSCO, Evergreen, Yang Ming, Hyundai, Wan Hai
- **Europe**: Hapag-Lloyd, CMA CGM, Arkas, TNT, Royal Mail
- **Americas**: Crowley, FedEx, UPS, USPS, Canada Post
- **Mediterranean**: MSC, ZIM, Arkas

### 4. **Container Tracking Coverage**
```
Container Numbers: All 9 ocean carriers + 3 aggregators
Booking Numbers: Major carriers (Maersk, MSC, CMA CGM, COSCO, Hapag-Lloyd)
Bill of Lading: Tier 1 carriers (Maersk, MSC, COSCO) + aggregators
Vessel Tracking: Marine Traffic, Vessel Finder (real-time positions)
Container Status: All providers (loaded, discharged, gate-out, etc.)
```

## ðŸš€ Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Container Implementation (Month 1)
1. **Free Tier**: Track-Trace (no API costs)
2. **Major Carriers**: Maersk, MSC (high success rate)
3. **Freemium Aggregators**: ShipsGo, SeaRates (good coverage, low cost)

### Phase 2: Enhanced Container Coverage (Month 2)
1. **Additional Major Carriers**: CMA CGM, COSCO, Hapag-Lloyd
2. **Regional Carriers**: Evergreen, ONE, Yang Ming
3. **Vessel Tracking**: Marine Traffic, Vessel Finder

### Phase 3: Complete Container Ecosystem (Month 3)
1. **Remaining Carriers**: ZIM (complete major carrier coverage)
2. **Premium Aggregator**: Project44 (enterprise-grade fallback)
3. **Advanced Features**: Real-time vessel positions, port congestion data

## ðŸ’¡ Smart Routing Algorithm

### Request Flow:
```
1. Detect tracking number format â†’ Determine likely carriers
2. Check free/freemium APIs first (cost optimization)
3. Try high-reliability paid APIs (success optimization)
4. Use aggregators as comprehensive fallback
5. Cache successful results to reduce future API calls
```

### Example Routing for Container "ABCD1234567":
```
1. Try: Track-Trace (free) â†’ 30% success chance
2. Try: Maersk (paid) â†’ 95% success chance  
3. Try: MSC (paid) â†’ 88% success chance
4. Fallback: Project44 (premium) â†’ 93% success chance across 100+ carriers
5. Cache: Store result for 2 hours to avoid repeat calls
```

## ðŸ“ˆ Expected Performance

### Success Rates by Container Tracking Type:
- **Container Numbers**: 98% success rate
- **Booking Numbers**: 94% success rate
- **Bill of Lading**: 88% success rate
- **Vessel Tracking**: 92% success rate
- **Container Status Updates**: 96% success rate

### Cost Efficiency:
- **Average Cost per Successful Track**: $0.05-0.15
- **Free API Usage**: 40% of requests
- **Paid API Usage**: 60% of requests
- **ROI**: High user satisfaction with reasonable API costs

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### API Prioritization Logic:
```typescript
const getProviderPriority = (trackingNumber: string, trackingType: string) => {
  // 1. Free APIs first (cost optimization)
  const freeProviders = providers.filter(p => p.cost === 'free');
  
  // 2. High-reliability paid APIs
  const paidProviders = providers
    .filter(p => p.cost === 'paid' && p.reliability > 0.9)
    .sort((a, b) => b.reliability - a.reliability);
  
  // 3. Aggregators as comprehensive fallback
  const aggregators = providers
    .filter(p => p.aggregator === true)
    .sort((a, b) => b.reliability - a.reliability);
    
  return [...freeProviders, ...paidProviders, ...aggregators];
};
```

### Rate Limit Management:
```typescript
const rateLimitStrategy = {
  free: { requestsPerMinute: 10, requestsPerHour: 100 },
  freemium: { requestsPerMinute: 30, requestsPerHour: 500 },
  paid: { requestsPerMinute: 60, requestsPerHour: 2000 },
  premium: { requestsPerMinute: 200, requestsPerHour: 10000 }
};
```
