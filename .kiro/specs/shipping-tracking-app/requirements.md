# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a modern shipping tracking application that allows users to track shipments using various tracking numbers. The application will provide real-time tracking information with a clean, professional interface similar to industry leaders like Flexport or Freightos.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to search for shipments using different tracking number types, so that I can track packages regardless of which identifier I have.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters a booking number THEN the system SHALL accept and process the booking number format
2. WHEN a user enters a container number THEN the system SHALL accept and process the container number format  
3. WHEN a user enters a bill of lading number THEN the system SHALL accept and process the bill of lading format
4. WHEN a user enters an invalid tracking number format THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages with format examples
5. WHEN a user starts typing THEN the system SHALL automatically detect the tracking number type based on format patterns

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see comprehensive tracking information in an organized layout, so that I can quickly understand my shipment's current status and details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tracking data is retrieved THEN the system SHALL display a visual timeline showing all shipment milestones
2. WHEN displaying the timeline THEN the system SHALL highlight the current status and show completion percentage
3. WHEN showing shipment details THEN the system SHALL display basic info including tracking number, service type, carrier, and vessel information
4. WHEN presenting route information THEN the system SHALL show origin/destination ports, departure/arrival times
5. WHEN displaying container details THEN the system SHALL show container numbers, sizes, seal numbers, and dimensions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see my shipment's route on an interactive map, so that I can visualize the shipping journey and current location.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN shipment data includes route information THEN the system SHALL display an interactive map with the shipping route
2. WHEN showing the route THEN the system SHALL display origin and destination markers clearly
3. IF vessel position data is available THEN the system SHALL show current vessel location on the map
4. WHEN displaying port stops THEN the system SHALL show intermediate ports along the route
5. WHEN a user clicks on map markers THEN the system SHALL display detailed information about that location

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to work seamlessly across different devices, so that I can track shipments whether I'm on desktop or mobile.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the application on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL display a mobile-optimized interface
2. WHEN using the application on different screen sizes THEN the system SHALL maintain usability and readability
3. WHEN interacting with the map on touch devices THEN the system SHALL support touch gestures for navigation
4. WHEN viewing tracking information on small screens THEN the system SHALL prioritize essential information visibility

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive clear feedback during searches and loading, so that I understand what the system is doing and when something goes wrong.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a search is initiated THEN the system SHALL display loading indicators with progress messages
2. WHEN API calls are in progress THEN the system SHALL show skeleton loading states for content areas
3. WHEN a tracking number is not found THEN the system SHALL display a clear "not found" message with suggestions
4. WHEN API services are unavailable THEN the system SHALL show error messages and attempt alternative data sources
5. WHEN network connectivity issues occur THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages with retry options

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want my recent searches to be remembered, so that I can quickly re-track shipments I've looked up before.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user performs a successful search THEN the system SHALL store the tracking number in local search history
2. WHEN a user starts typing in the search field THEN the system SHALL suggest recent searches as auto-complete options
3. WHEN displaying search history THEN the system SHALL show the most recent searches first
4. WHEN a user selects a recent search THEN the system SHALL immediately perform the tracking lookup

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to integrate with multiple shipping carriers and APIs, so that I can track shipments from various providers in one place.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system cannot find data from the primary API THEN the system SHALL attempt to retrieve data from alternative APIs
2. WHEN multiple APIs return conflicting data THEN the system SHALL prioritize the most reliable source and indicate data source
3. WHEN API rate limits are reached THEN the system SHALL implement caching to reduce redundant requests
4. WHEN all APIs are unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade and inform the user of limited functionality

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to be accessible to users with disabilities, so that everyone can use the tracking functionality effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using screen readers THEN the system SHALL provide proper ARIA labels for all interactive elements
2. WHEN navigating with keyboard only THEN the system SHALL support full keyboard navigation through all features
3. WHEN users require high contrast THEN the system SHALL support high contrast mode for better visibility
4. WHEN displaying important information THEN the system SHALL not rely solely on color to convey meaning

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to load quickly and perform well, so that I can get tracking information without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL achieve initial page load in under 2 seconds
2. WHEN displaying tracking results THEN the system SHALL cache API responses to improve subsequent load times
3. WHEN loading large amounts of data THEN the system SHALL implement code splitting to load components on demand
4. WHEN the application is used frequently THEN the system SHALL maintain 95%+ successful tracking lookups

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a user, I want my data to be secure and private, so that I can trust the application with my shipment information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN transmitting data THEN the system SHALL use HTTPS encryption for all communications
2. WHEN storing user data THEN the system SHALL not persist sensitive shipment information beyond necessary caching
3. WHEN handling API requests THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
4. WHEN processing user input THEN the system SHALL validate and sanitize all inputs to prevent security vulnerabilities
