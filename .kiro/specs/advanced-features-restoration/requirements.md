# Advanced Features Restoration - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the systematic restoration and enhancement of advanced features for the Shipping Tracker application. The goal is to transform the current working basic application into a fully-featured, production-ready shipping tracking system with comprehensive API integration, advanced UI components, and robust error handling.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: API Server Stabilization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a stable and functional API server, so that the frontend can communicate with backend services reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the API server starts THEN it SHALL start without TypeScript compilation errors
2. WHEN the API server receives requests THEN it SHALL respond with appropriate HTTP status codes
3. WHEN environment variables are missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback to demo mode
4. WHEN API keys are invalid or missing THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle the error and use mock data
5. IF Sentry is not configured THEN the system SHALL continue to function without error tracking
6. WHEN the database is unavailable THEN the API SHALL continue to serve cached or mock data

### Requirement 2: API Integration and Aggregation

**User Story:** As a user, I want to track shipments from multiple carriers and data sources, so that I can get comprehensive tracking information regardless of the shipping provider.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I search for a tracking number THEN the system SHALL query multiple API providers concurrently
2. WHEN API providers return different data formats THEN the system SHALL normalize the data into a consistent format
3. WHEN some API providers fail THEN the system SHALL continue with successful providers and show partial results
4. WHEN all API providers fail THEN the system SHALL provide demo data with clear indication it's mock data
5. WHEN API rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL queue requests and retry with exponential backoff
6. WHEN tracking numbers are invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear validation feedback

### Requirement 3: Enhanced Loading States and User Feedback

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see detailed progress and feedback during tracking searches, so that I understand what's happening and can make informed decisions about waiting or trying alternatives.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I initiate a search THEN I SHALL see a progressive loading interface showing which APIs are being queried
2. WHEN searches take longer than expected THEN I SHALL see timeout warnings and alternative options
3. WHEN API providers respond at different speeds THEN I SHALL see real-time updates of which providers have completed
4. WHEN searches fail THEN I SHALL see specific error messages and suggested actions
5. WHEN I want to cancel a search THEN I SHALL be able to stop the process immediately
6. WHEN searches timeout THEN I SHALL be offered demo data or alternative tracking numbers

### Requirement 4: Advanced UI Components Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want a rich, interactive interface with maps, timelines, and detailed shipment information, so that I can visualize and understand my shipment's journey comprehensively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view shipment details THEN I SHALL see an interactive map showing the shipment route
2. WHEN I view the timeline THEN I SHALL see a detailed, interactive timeline with all tracking events
3. WHEN I use the application on mobile THEN I SHALL have touch-optimized components with swipe gestures
4. WHEN I view shipment details THEN I SHALL see comprehensive information including container details, vessel information, and estimated delivery
5. WHEN I interact with the map THEN I SHALL be able to zoom, pan, and click on ports for additional information
6. WHEN I view the timeline THEN I SHALL see progress indicators and completion percentages

### Requirement 5: State Management and Data Persistence

**User Story:** As a user, I want my search history and preferences to be saved, so that I can quickly access previously tracked shipments and have a personalized experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I search for tracking numbers THEN they SHALL be saved to my search history
2. WHEN I return to the application THEN I SHALL see my recent searches
3. WHEN I favorite a shipment THEN it SHALL be saved for quick access
4. WHEN I have network connectivity issues THEN the application SHALL work offline with cached data
5. WHEN I refresh the page THEN my current search state SHALL be preserved
6. WHEN I share a tracking link THEN others SHALL be able to view the same shipment details

### Requirement 6: Error Handling and Resilience

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to handle errors gracefully and provide helpful guidance, so that I can successfully track my shipments even when things go wrong.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API services are unavailable THEN I SHALL see clear error messages with suggested alternatives
2. WHEN my internet connection is poor THEN the application SHALL retry requests automatically
3. WHEN I encounter errors THEN I SHALL be able to report issues with one click
4. WHEN the application crashes THEN I SHALL see a helpful error boundary with recovery options
5. WHEN API responses are malformed THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully without breaking
6. WHEN I experience repeated failures THEN I SHALL be offered demo mode or alternative solutions

### Requirement 7: Performance and Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want fast loading times and smooth interactions, so that I can efficiently track my shipments without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I load the application THEN it SHALL render the initial interface within 2 seconds
2. WHEN I search for tracking information THEN I SHALL see results within 10 seconds or clear progress updates
3. WHEN I navigate between views THEN transitions SHALL be smooth and responsive
4. WHEN I use the application on mobile THEN it SHALL be optimized for touch interactions and small screens
5. WHEN I have slow internet THEN the application SHALL prioritize critical content and show loading states
6. WHEN I return to previously viewed shipments THEN they SHALL load instantly from cache

### Requirement 8: Analytics and Monitoring Integration

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive monitoring and analytics, so that I can ensure system reliability and understand user behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be automatically reported to monitoring systems
2. WHEN users interact with the application THEN usage analytics SHALL be collected (with privacy compliance)
3. WHEN API performance degrades THEN alerts SHALL be triggered
4. WHEN system resources are under stress THEN monitoring SHALL provide early warnings
5. WHEN users experience issues THEN diagnostic information SHALL be available for troubleshooting
6. WHEN system updates are deployed THEN performance metrics SHALL be tracked for regression detection

### Requirement 9: Mobile-First Responsive Design

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want a fully optimized mobile experience with touch gestures and mobile-specific features, so that I can effectively track shipments on my phone.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use the application on mobile THEN all features SHALL be accessible and optimized for touch
2. WHEN I swipe on timeline or map components THEN they SHALL respond with appropriate gestures
