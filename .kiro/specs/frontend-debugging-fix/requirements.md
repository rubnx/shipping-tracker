# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The shipping tracker React frontend application is currently showing a white screen with JavaScript errors preventing proper rendering. We need to systematically identify and fix all issues to get the application running properly. The main error identified is a missing export `APIProvider` from the `useEnhancedLoading` hook, but there may be additional issues preventing the app from rendering.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the React application to render without JavaScript errors, so that I can see the user interface and continue development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the development server is started THEN the application SHALL load without console errors
2. WHEN the application loads THEN the user SHALL see the SimpleTestApp component with a green success message
3. WHEN the application loads THEN the main App component SHALL render below the test component
4. IF there are import errors THEN the system SHALL identify and fix all missing exports and imports
5. IF there are component errors THEN the system SHALL ensure all referenced components exist and are properly exported

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all TypeScript imports and exports to be correctly configured, so that the application compiles and runs without module resolution errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN importing types THEN the system SHALL use proper TypeScript type imports (e.g., `import type { ... }`)
2. WHEN importing components THEN the system SHALL verify all components exist and are properly exported
3. WHEN importing hooks THEN the system SHALL ensure all hook exports match their usage
4. IF a component is missing THEN the system SHALL create a minimal stub component or remove the import
5. IF an export is missing THEN the system SHALL add the proper export or fix the import path

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the error boundary to catch and display any remaining React errors, so that I can identify issues that prevent rendering.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a React component throws an error THEN the ErrorBoundary SHALL catch it and display an error message
2. WHEN an error occurs THEN the user SHALL see a helpful error message with debugging information in development mode
3. WHEN the error boundary is triggered THEN the user SHALL have options to refresh or try again
4. IF the error boundary catches an error THEN the system SHALL log the error details to the console
5. WHEN the application is in production THEN the error boundary SHALL hide sensitive debugging information

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify that all essential dependencies are properly installed and configured, so that the application has all required packages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN checking dependencies THEN the system SHALL verify all imported packages are installed
2. WHEN a dependency is missing THEN the system SHALL install it or provide installation instructions
3. WHEN there are version conflicts THEN the system SHALL resolve them or provide guidance
4. IF React Query is used THEN the QueryProvider SHALL be properly configured
5. IF Zustand is used THEN the store SHALL be properly configured and accessible

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the development environment to be properly configured, so that I can run the application locally without build errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `pnpm dev` THEN the development server SHALL start successfully
2. WHEN the server starts THEN Vite SHALL compile the application without TypeScript errors
3. WHEN accessing the application THEN the browser SHALL load the page without network errors
4. IF there are build errors THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages
5. WHEN hot reload is triggered THEN the application SHALL update without losing state

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a systematic debugging approach, so that I can identify and fix issues in a logical order.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN debugging THEN the system SHALL start with the most critical errors first (import/export issues)
2. WHEN an error is fixed THEN the system SHALL verify the fix before moving to the next issue
3. WHEN multiple errors exist THEN the system SHALL prioritize errors that block application startup
4. IF new errors appear THEN the system SHALL address them before continuing with other fixes
5. WHEN all errors are resolved THEN the system SHALL verify the complete application renders correctly
